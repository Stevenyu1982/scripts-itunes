# applescript-itunes

A collection of AppleScripts for iTunes Iâ€™ve found useful.

# Installation

Fork the repo then install with:

```
git clone https://github.com/chauncey-garrett/applescript-itunes.git $HOME/Library/iTunes/Scripts
```

If you plan on contributing back to the repository, add the following to `.git/config`. This code will ensure that the AppleScripts are viewable under version control by decompiling them to plain text before updating the repository.

```
[filter "ascr"]
	clean = "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/git-ascr-filter.sh --clean %f
	smudge = "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"/git-ascr-filter.sh --smudge %f"
```
